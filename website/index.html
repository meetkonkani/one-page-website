          <h2><span class="text-primary-1">History </span>of RE</h2>
          <p>
            In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form 'Enfield India' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components. By 1962, all components were made in India.</p>

               <h3>STRONGER
                THAN TIME</h3>
               <p>Central to the All-New Classic 350, is an all-new heart which beats to
                Royal Enfield’s unique rhythm. Partnered with a new twin downtube
                chassis that rides strong and true, and a solid, dependable build
                quality, the Classic is your ally wherever the destination may be.
                The upright riding position gives the Classic rider a commanding road
                presence while larger diameter brakes beef up its stopping power. But
                stronger doesn’t just mean capable and tough, the Classic is endowed
                with comfort too, with its improved, wider seat cosseting its rider.

            <h3>SMOOTHER
              WITH EVERY RIDE</h3>
            <p>Gliding down the open road, swooping around twisting bends,
              weaving through city streets or winding along country trails, the
              versatile timeless Classic is equipped with wider bars and tyres for
              effortless and secure manoeuvrability. Designed with a balancer shaft
              for silken revs, the light clutch for gentle gearshifts, and the
              impeccably-mapped fuel injection on the new 350 J platform
              delivering the smoothest, most refined ride experience that will
              soothe, bewitch and thrill its rider.

            <h3>SMARTER
              UP TO THE MINUTE</h3>
            <p>Timeless also means ‘up with the times’, and Classic’s new instrument
              cluster combines the gracefulness of a ‘dancing needle’ analogue
              speedometer with the functionality of an LCD display. A discreet USB port
              mounted below the handlebars enables essential charging on-the-go and
              the confidence-inspiring Dual Channel ABS sets a standard on all except the
              Redditch editions. Royal Enfield’s unique turn-by-turn navigation pod,
              Tripper, augments the gorgeous Chrome Red and Chrome Bronze Classics,
              while the Make It Yours (MIY) platform allows new owners to tap into a
              plethora of personalisation options at the time of booking itself.</p>

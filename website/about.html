                <h1 class="l-heading"> <span class="text-primary"></span>The Indian Connection</h1>
                The British roots of Royal Enfield got an Indian soul in 1955, when Madras Motors started manufacturing the motorcycles in Chennai. Six decades later, it has led the leisure motorcycling culture in India from the front. The iconic motorcycles have been accomplices to a thousand adventures and the dependable steed of the men in uniform. The upbeat response to the latest models is testimony to the fact that motorcycles are still trusted, loved and rode upon.
